**Sandboxed microVMs on your own hosts, driven by an API.**

Fuse is a control plane for Firecracker and QEMU microVMs. Register your hosts, describe a
workload in a `Fusefile`, and Fuse schedules it, boots the VM, and tracks the whole lifecycle
(provision, running, drain, destroy) with snapshots, fork, exec, live event streams, and
Prometheus metrics. CPU workloads run on Firecracker; GPU workloads run on QEMU hosts with
whole cards or MIG slices.

You bring the hosts. State lives in Postgres and on your disks, nowhere else.

## Install

```bash
brew install --cask folsomintel/fuse/fuse
```

Upgrade with `brew upgrade --cask fuse`, check with `fuse --version`. On Linux, grab the
`fuse-cli_Linux_*.tar.gz` archive from the
[latest release](https://github.com/folsomintel/fuse/releases/latest), or build from a
checkout with `go build -o bin/fuse ./cli`. Mind the naming: the `fuse_*` archives are the
orchestrator, `fuse-cli_*` is the CLI.

## First run

The CLI is only a client. You need an orchestrator reachable over HTTP and at least one host
agent running before it can do anything. `sudo ./fc-agent.sh bootstrap` in
[`host-agent/`](host-agent/) brings both up on a single machine.

```bash
fuse quickstart   # connect an orchestrator, register a host
fuse init         # scaffold a Fusefile
fuse up --secret pg_password=devpassword

fuse environment list
fuse environment exec <id> -- echo hello
fuse environment fork <id>
```

`quickstart` needs a tty. Headless, run the two commands it wraps:

```bash
fuse connect https://orch.example.com --token "$ORCH_AUTH_TOKEN"
fuse host register prod-east-1 --url http://10.0.0.5:8090 --token "$FC_AGENT_TOKEN" --max-vms 20
```

## Contributing

Go 1.26 monorepo, no Makefile. Most tests run against in-memory stubs, so you need neither
VMs nor Postgres to work on it.

```bash
gofmt -l .                     # must print nothing
go vet ./...
go build ./...
go test ./... -race -count=1
golangci-lint run ./...        # pinned to v2.12.2 in ci
```
