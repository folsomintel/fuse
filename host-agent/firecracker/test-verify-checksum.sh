# Unit test for the release-asset checksum verification helper that guards the
# installer/updater download paths.
#
# The helper is embedded (not sourced) in three scripts, so this test extracts
# the block from each, asserts the copies have not drifted, and then exercises the
# helper against the cases that matter: a good asset, a tampered one, a
# truncated one, a missing checksums file, an empty one, a missing entry, and a
# host with no checksum tool on PATH.
#
# No network, no root, no VMs:  ./host-agent/firecracker/test-verify-checksum.sh
