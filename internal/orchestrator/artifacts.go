// Content-addressed build artifacts, and moving them between hosts.
//
// An artifact is a rootfs file sitting in one host agent's snapshot store. That
// is the whole reason this file exists: an environment seeded from an artifact
// could previously only be born on the one host that happened to hold it, so a
// cache hit could turn a working `fuse up` into a failing one the moment that
// host filled up. The fix is to make the artifact follow the workload instead
// of the workload following the artifact.
//
// Three properties are load-bearing and none of them are negotiable.
//
// The orchestrator is the INDEX and the COORDINATOR, never the data path.
// Artifacts run from a few hundred megabytes to tens of gigabytes, and this
// control plane is a single process with a single replica. Relaying blobs
// through it would make one goroutine's copy loop the bandwidth ceiling for the
// entire fleet, and would put a multi-gigabyte transfer in the same process
// that has to answer health checks. Bytes go host to host; the orchestrator
// only says who should fetch what from whom, and hands over a capability to do
// it (see internal/hostwire.MintArtifactGrant).
//
// The index is DERIVED from snapshot records, not stored alongside them. A
// snapshot row already asserts "host H holds artifact A"; a second copy of that
// fact could only ever disagree with the first, and the disagreement would stay
// invisible until a pull was aimed at a host that no longer had the bytes.
// Deriving also answers the recovery question by making it vacuous: there is
// nothing to rehydrate at startup, because the query IS the index. Losing the
// mapping (a row whose digest was never recorded, from an agent build that
// predates hashing) loses only findability -- the artifact is still on disk and
// still bootable by id, and its digest is recoverable by rehashing the file.
//
// A digest is an INTEGRITY CHECK on one artifact's bytes and never a
// cross-build identity. Two builds of the same recipe produce different rootfs
// bytes (timestamps, inode ordering, package caches), so rows that share a
// digest are copies of a single artifact, which is precisely what a peer pull
// creates. Nothing here dedups, and nothing may start.

// ArtifactEndpoint identifies one side of a host-to-host artifact transfer.
// Token is the host agent's own bearer token, which the orchestrator already
// stores in order to talk to that host at all.

// reconcileArtifacts collects layer artifacts nothing needs any more, and

//
// Why this exists: build artifacts are exempt from retention gc and from the
// snapshot quota, deliberately, because sweeping a named `fuse build` output
// would break every environment that references it with nothing to tell the
// operator why. Per-step layers made that exemption untenable -- one build now
// produces an artifact per cacheable step instead of one for the whole build --
// so layers get a ceiling of their own here while named build artifacts keep
// the explicit-delete-only contract they had.
//
// Scope is therefore narrow and intentional: SnapshotModeBuild artifacts with a
// non-empty LayerKey. Those are machine-derived and reproducible (a miss just
// rebuilds the step), which is exactly what makes them safe to evict and unsafe
// to keep forever.
//
// Both ceilings are off unless configured. Turning eviction on by default would

// relying on, which is not a thing an upgrade may do.
