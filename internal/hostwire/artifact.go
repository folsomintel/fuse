// Peer-to-peer artifact transfer.
//
// Two very different calls live here and must not be conflated:
//
//   - PullArtifact is orchestrator to host: a small authenticated JSON POST
//     telling host B to go fetch a blob. It uses NewClient, because it is an
//     ordinary control-plane call with an ordinary control-plane deadline.
//   - FetchArtifact is the blob transfer itself: many gigabytes, no bearer
//     token, authorized by a grant. It uses NewArtifactClient, whose timeout
//     shape is the opposite of NewClient's.
//
// The Go FetchArtifact is a second implementation of what the Python agent
// does on the pulling side. Keeping it here means the wire contract (header
// name, path shape, verify-then-commit ordering) is exercised by tests in this
// repo rather than only in production.

// Path shapes, in one place so the Go client and any future caller cannot
// drift from each other. Digests are validated as lowercase hex before use, so
// there is nothing here that needs URL escaping.
const (
	artifactPathPrefix = "/v1/artifacts/"
	artifactPullSuffix = "/pull"
)

// Timeouts for a blob transfer.
//
// There is deliberately NO overall request timeout. NewClient's 10 minute
// ceiling is right for control-plane calls, whose duration is bounded by what
// the agent has to do; it is wrong here, because transfer time is a function
// of artifact size and link speed, neither of which this side knows. A total
// deadline would kill a perfectly healthy 40 GiB pull over a slow link, and
// the only way to pick one that never does is to pick one so large it stops
// detecting anything. Any fixed number is either too small for the biggest
// legitimate transfer or too large to be a useful failure detector.
//
// So instead of bounding the whole thing, bound the parts whose duration does
// NOT scale with size (connect, TLS, and time to first byte), and then require
// PROGRESS on the body via a stall timeout. A transfer that is moving is
// allowed to take as long as it takes; a transfer that has stopped moving
// fails quickly, which is the condition anyone actually wanted to detect.

// DefaultMaxArtifactBytes caps how much a peer may stream before the pull is
// abandoned. Without a cap, a hostile or broken peer can serve an endless body
// and fill the puller's disk, and the digest check is no defence because it
// only fails once the stream ends.
//
// 128 GiB is well above any plausible rootfs artifact (the largest environment
// disks in the fleet are an order of magnitude smaller) while still being a
