// Host-to-host artifact grants.
//
// A host pulling an artifact from another host is a new trust edge: until now
// every agent only ever trusted `Bearer $FC_AGENT_TOKEN` presented by the
// orchestrator. Handing the pulling host the serving host's token would
// over-grant catastrophically, because that token is full control of the
// serving host: create VMs, exec in guests, delete snapshots.
//
// Instead the orchestrator mints a capability that the serving host can verify
// entirely on its own. The key is the serving host's own agent token, which
// needs no new key distribution: the orchestrator already stores every host's
// token in order to talk to it at all.
//
//	grant = "v1." + digest + "." + expiry_unix + "." + nonce + "." + mac
//	mac   = HMAC-SHA256(
//	            key = <FC_AGENT_TOKEN of the SERVING host>,
//	            msg = "fuse-artifact-grant/v1\n" + digest + "\n"
//	                  + expiry_unix + "\n" + nonce)
//
// What this buys, and why each part matters:
//
//   - the pulling host never learns the serving host's token. HMAC is one way,
//     so possession of (message, mac) does not yield the key.
//   - the grant authorizes exactly one digest on exactly one endpoint. The
//     digest is inside the signed preimage and the verifier also checks it
//     against the digest in the request path, so a grant for blob X cannot be
//     replayed against blob Y, and it is not a general credential for the
//     serving agent's API.
//   - the grant is worthless after expiry. Nothing has to revoke it.
//   - the serving host never has to call the orchestrator to verify. Pulls stay
//     possible while the control plane is busy, restarting, or unreachable,
//     and verification costs one HMAC rather than a network round trip.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT defend against, so nobody assumes more:
//
//   - within its TTL the grant is replayable by anyone who holds it. There is
//     no per-grant server-side state, no nonce ledger, no binding to the
//     pulling host's identity or address. That is acceptable because the only
//     thing a replay achieves is re-reading one blob whose contents the holder
//     was already authorized to read. It grants no write, no exec, and no
//     access to any other artifact.
//   - it says nothing about who the puller is. It is a bearer capability, not
//     an authentication of the peer.
//   - it does not protect the blob in transit. Confidentiality on the wire is
//     TLS's job, exactly as it is for every other orchestrator-to-agent call.
//
// The live verifier is the Python host agent, which recomputes the same mac
// and compares it with hmac.compare_digest. The Go verifier below is not on
// that path; it exists so the scheme is testable in this repo and so the wire
// format is pinned by a second independent implementation. If the two ever
// disagree, one of them is a bug and the tests here are what catch it.
